## Manual Testing
Manual tests have been performed and documented to ensure the usability and proper function of the website. This testing involved trying multiple options on each page to try to find if any of the website functions were not working as expected. These were all documented in Github annd the list can be found <a href="https://legends-gym-b229ec203712.herokuapp.com/"> HERE </a>. <br> An example of manual testing of one of the pages on the site can seen below.
